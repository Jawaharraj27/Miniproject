## Title of the Project

Satellite Image Detection Using Mathematical CLIP Model

Small Description about the Project

The project focuses on automatic detection and understanding of satellite images by integrating the CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pre-training) model, enabling efficient image–text matching to reduce manual effort in satellite image analysis.

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->

Satellite Image Detection Using Mathematical CLIP Model is an AI-based project designed to analyze satellite images and associate them with meaningful textual descriptions. Traditional satellite image analysis requires expert knowledge and manual interpretation, which is time-consuming and inefficient.

This project leverages the CLIP model, which combines computer vision and natural language processing to understand images and text together. Satellite images such as land areas, water bodies, forests, buildings, and roads are processed and compared with predefined text descriptions using similarity measures. By mapping visual features to textual concepts, the system enables faster and more accurate satellite image interpretation.

The project demonstrates how modern AI models can be applied to remote sensing applications, improving efficiency and reducing dependency on manual analysis.
